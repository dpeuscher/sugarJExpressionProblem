\chapter*{Preface}

This paper is written as part of a bachelors degree. The engineered result, examples and use cases are published on Github.com\cite{Peuscher-GitHub-EP-2014}.% We take the equality of people of different genders very serious. We chose to refer in general to a male reader in terms of readability. Every mention of a male reader is meant to be gender-neutral.



%%%%%%%% Introduction
\chapter{Introduction}

We extend Java with a specific syntax for the \emph{Expression Problem} (EP). Therefore we use a solution of the EP which has been modified so that much of the boilerplate code can be generated. The resulting solution is difficult for users to understand and adapt to their needs. We overcome this difficulty, by defining a new syntax that is easier to understand. It is then transformed into valid Java code. The new syntax and the transformation to Java is implemented in a \emph{SugarJ library}. This approach is meant to simplify the use of a solution to the EP.

The Expression Problem is a name that was proposed by Philip Wadler \cite{Wadler-Expression-1998}. It refers to the problem of adding both new types and new operations to a given code-structure. Generally, \emph{object-oriented languages} make it easy to add new types to code and \emph{function languages} make it easy to add new operations to code (this extendibility is a key feature of modern programming languages). Classes inherit from other classes in object-oriented languages and functions inherit from other functions in functional languages. These are the two dimensions of Inheritance. The Expression Problem is found in both functional and object-oriented languages and it occurs when one tries to extend a data structure in both dimensions. This thesis uses a solution that overcomes this problem in the object-oriented language Java.

There are many papers that present solutions to this problem. The solution developed in this thesis is a modification of the solution proposed by Oliveira et. al., which enables much of the boilerplate code to be  easily generated \cite{Oliv-Extensibility-2012}. The modifications made to Oliveira et. al.'s solution includes the use of stateful objects and the use of \emph{delegation} instead of combined object algebras to allow \emph{dependent methods}\footnote{\emph{Dependent methods} are methods that depend on other methods (i.e. calls them) of the same object instance.}.

Extending a programming language (which is Java in this case) with new syntax is a way to support special use cases with a fixed pattern. The syntax and their extension is specified in \emph{syntax definition formalism} (SDF), which uses the definitions of a \emph{context free language} (CFL) \cite{Heering-SDF-1989}. The code in the extended syntax is parsed using these rules and generates an \emph{ATerm} \cite{Brand-ATerms-2000}. This \emph{ATerm} is the representation of the program in the extended language. To get valid Java from this extended language \emph{Stratego} rules are used to rewrite the \emph{ATerm}. The \emph{Stratego} rules are the formal representation of the solution to the EP. After the application of the solution the \emph{ATerm} can be pretty-printed into valid Java code. The process from parsing the new syntax to printing it out to Java is managed by \emph{SugarJ} \cite{Erdweg-SugarJ-2011}.

\emph{SugarJ} is a language extension framework that uses \emph{SDF}, \emph{Stratego} and the \emph{Spoofax framework} \cite{Kats-Spoofax-2010}. It can be used with \emph{integrated development environments} (IDE) to support syntax highlighting for the new syntax. The generated code does not depend on \emph{SugarJ} and so allows collaborative work across different environments. This thesis is also a case study, which outlines the experiences gained using SugarJ (a relatively young framework) to develop the syntax extension. We also give the reader an impression of the time and effort required to use SugarJ.


%%%%%%%%% Solution to the Expression Problem
\chapter{Solution to the Expression Problem}

In this chapter we develop a solution to the Expression Problem based on a solution developed by Oliveira et. al. \cite{Oliv-Extensibility-2012}. We modify it to a state where much of the code can easily be generated. We use object algebras for the factorization of the Expression objects and delegation for independent extensibility \cite{Tempero-Multiple-2000}. In the next chapter we describe the development of a SugarJ library that can generate the code for this solution.


%%%%%% The Problem
\section{The Problem}
\label{theProblem}

Although the problem was discussed as early as 1975 by Reynolds, the name "\emph{Expression Problem}" was proposed by Wadler in 1998 on the Java Genericity Mailing List \cite{Reynolds-Abstraction-1975, Wadler-Expression-1998}. The Expression Problem is a problem of extensibility. An extension of code means either adding new types that implement a fixed interface or alter an interface to support new operations. In \emph{object-oriented programming} (OOP) it is easy to add new types. A type is declared to implement an interface and the existing interface and classes do not have to be modified or recompiled. To add new operations one would have to alter the existing interfaces and classes, which might be erroneous or not even possible (e.g. when the source code is not available). By extending both (interfaces and classes) the static type safety is not ensured. Using \emph{casts} could fix this, however, it leads to an increased risk of runtime exceptions.

The requirements on a solution to the problem are proposed by Wadler and Zenger et. al. \cite{Wadler-Expression-1998, Odersky-Expression-2005, Oliv-Extensibility-2012}. Only when a solution meets all of the requirements can it be considered a valid solution. The requirements are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Extensibility in both dimensions}: A solution must allow the addition of new data variants and new operations and support extending existing operations.
  \item \emph{Strong static type safety}: A solution must prevent applying an operation to a data variant, which it cannot handle using static checks.
  \item \emph{No modification or duplication}: Existing code must neither be modified nor duplicated.
  \item \emph{Separate compilation}: Safety checks or compilation steps must not be deferred until link or runtime.
  \item \emph{Independent extensibility}: It should be possible to combine independently developed extensions so that they can be used jointly.
\end{itemize}


%%%%%% Running Example
\subsection{Running Example}
\label{example}

To clarify the problem and the solution we use an example that is used in much of the literature about the EP. The example consists of simple abstract mathematical expressions (e.g. 1 + 2) with two types: \emph{Literals} (in this case natural numbers: 1, 2, 3, ...) and the \emph{Add operation}. The base package\footnote{It is not mandatory a \emph{package}. We consider \emph{package} as editable entity} only consists of the lit-object with a print-method (Figure \ref{exampleLitBaseClass}).

Note that the code-example in this section is considered a "not valid solution".


\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
interface IPrint {
    public String print();
}
class Lit implements IPrint {
    private Integer x;
    public Lit(Integer x) { this.x = x; }
    public String print() { return x.toString(); }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Static \textbf{base package}: a simple \lstinline{Lit}-class with \lstinline{print} operation that is to be extended}
\label{exampleLitBaseClass}
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
interface IPrintCount extends IPrint {
    public Integer count();
}
class Lit2 extends Lit implements IPrintCount {
    public Integer count() { return 1; }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\textbf{First extension}: Adding the new operation \lstinline{count} to \lstinline{Lit} from the base package}
\label{exampleFirstExtension}
\end{figure}

The \emph{first extension} extends the base package by a new \emph{operation}. With the new operation \lstinline{count}\footnote{\lstinline{count} counts the amount of connected symbols in the expression} we need to extend the interface with the operation and create a new type \lstinline{Lit2} that implements the new interface (see figure \ref{exampleFirstExtension}).

The \emph{second extension} extends the base package by a new \emph{type}. We create the new type \lstinline{Add} and implement the interface of the base package \lstinline{IPrint} (See figure \ref{exampleSecondExtension}).

The \emph{third extension} combines the \emph{first extension} and the \emph{second extension}. We create the new type \lstinline{Add2} that needs to cast calls to the \lstinline{left}- and \lstinline{right}-fields to \lstinline{IPrintCount} to exectute the \lstinline{count} operation on them (See figure \ref{exampleThirdExtension}). This violates the requirement for \emph{Strong static type safety} (see section \ref{theProblem}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
class Add implements IPrint {
    protected IPrint left;
    protected IPrint right;
    public Add(IPrint left, IPrint right) {
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
    public String print() {
        return left.print() + "+" + right.print();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\textbf{Second extension}: Adding the new type \lstinline{Add} that implements \lstinline{IPrint} from the base package}

    }
    public Integer count() {
        return 1 + (/*CAST*/(IPrintCount)left).count() 
                 + (/*CAST*/(IPrintCount)right).count();
    }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{\textbf{Third extension}: Combining the \emph{first} and \emph{second} extension is only possible with \lstinline{IPrintCount}-cast, because \lstinline{left} and \lstinline{right} are of \lstinline{IPrint} which do not know an operation \lstinline{count}. This violates the requirement \emph{Strong static type safety} therefore it is not a valid solution.}

\section{Background}

To solve this problem we use the idea of a solution to the Expression Problem, that was proposed by Oliveira et. al. \cite{Oliv-Extensibility-2012} to derive our own solution that features independent extensibility in another way than Oliveira et. al. The independent extensibility is done with delegation to which we develop a solution for dynamic binding.

This section introduces the technologies used. Note that code-examples in this section are either from the work of the authors of the technologies or our implementations of the ideas of their work.

%%%%%% Solution: Extensibility for the Masses

\subsection{Solution: Extensibility for the Masses}

The solution by Oliveira et. al. \cite{Oliv-Extensibility-2012} is an approach that uses \emph{Object Algebras}. Object algebras are related to the \emph{Abstract Factory} pattern, which is used to inject dependencies \cite{Gof-Design-1993}. The dependency injection with object algebras solves the requirement for \emph{Strong static type safety} (see section \ref{theProblem}). The other requirements are met by decoupling the operations from their generic Java types and creating an extra result type for every result of an operation (see figure \ref{differentAlgebras}). This elegantly bypasses most of the requirements including the requirement of \emph{Independent extensibility}, which is difficult to comply with.

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
    <A> A exp(IntAlg<A> v) {        return v.add(v.lit(3), v.lit(4));
    }
    void test() {        IntFactory base = new IntFactory();        IntPrint print = new IntPrint();        int x = exp(base).eval();// int x = exp.eval();
￼￼        String s = exp(print).print();    }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Extensibility for the Masses \cite{Oliv-Extensibility-2012} pages 8, 9. Every Operation has its own result type. The \emph{object algebra} decides the result type. \lstinline{IntFactory} returns an object with \lstinline{eval}-operation, \lstinline{IntPrint} returns an object with \lstinline{print}-operation}
\label{differentAlgebras}
\end{figure}

The extension of types is done by extending the \emph{object algebra interface} (\lstinline{IntAlg<A>} in figure \ref{differentAlgebras}) and the \emph{object algebras} whereas the extension of operations is done with an extra object algebra for every operation.

To add new types one would extend the object algebra interface, to add new operations one would create a new object algebra with a corresponding result (anonymous) class. To independently extend multiple extensions Oliveira et. al. proposed to use a special object algebra like \lstinline{Union<A>} and \lstinline{Combine<A,B>}. \lstinline{Union<A>} delegates the instantiation of result objects to the two or more different algebras that are to be combined. \lstinline{Combine<A,B>} returns a \lstinline{Pair<A,B>}-object with which operations that depend on other operations can be defined (see figure \ref{combineExampleOliv}).

This approach is very neat. However we chose not to use this solution for the following reasons:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Surrounding code}: Developers that write the surrounding code need a great deal of knowledge about the solution and its inner implementation. They do not get an interface that concludes all operations and they have to decide which interface introduces which operation (see figure \ref{combineExampleSurrounding}).
  \item \emph{Complexity}: The proposed extension relies on nesting the \lstinline{Union<A>}- and \lstinline{Combine<A,B>}-algebras and the \lstinline{Pair<A,B>}-result. This would become very complex. Our aim is to have a solution that can easily be generated and that does not seem possible with the complexity of this solution.
  \item \emph{Depending methods}: Oliveira et. al. presents a \lstinline{Debug} object algebra as an example of depending methods. This algebra prints out debug data on the console. There is no solution that has been shown to work with dependent methods that include a return value. We assume such a case would look like that described in figure \ref{dependentPrintTerm} which uses \emph{delegation}. However this is a very complex solution \cite{Tempero-Multiple-2000}. A similar solution is proposed by Oliveira et. al. in Scala \cite{Oliv-Feature-2013}.
\end{itemize}

  IntAlg<A> v1;  IntAlg<B> v2;

    this.v1 = v1;this.v2 = v2;
  }

      v1.add(e1.a(), e2.a()),
      v2.add(e1.b(), e2.b()));

\end{figure}


%%%%%% Delegation

\subsection{Delegation for Independent Extension}

Independent extension requires some kind of \emph{multiple inheritance}. We chose not to use the solution of Oliveira et. al. because of its complexity. Instead we simulate \emph{multiple inheritance} with \emph{interface-delegation} as proposed by Tempero et. al. \cite{Tempero-Multiple-2000}.

Java does not support \emph{multiple inheritance} for classes. To support \emph{independent extensibility} without multiple inheritance, we simulate it. For every \emph{super-type} (named \emph{parent}) that is inherited from, we instantiate an object\footnote{We consider every extension to be non-abstract} in the constructor. Every operation that is not implemented in the \emph{derived type} (named \emph{child}) is explicitly delegated to the \emph{parent} and the returned result of the \emph{parent} afterwards is returned by the \emph{child}s operation. This means that for every operation that a class has it has either its own implementation or a parent that it can delegate the operation to (see figure \ref{delegationExample}).

The combined class (\emph{child}) decides which operation is delegated to which parent. If only one of the parents implements the operation the child delegates the call to this parent. If more than one parent implements the operation, the child has to decide to which parent it delegates the calls. In languages that support \emph{multiple inheritance} an algorithm implicitly decides from which parent an operation is inherited\footnote{The algorithm is also important on which parent \lstinline{super()}-calls are executed, if the language supports them}. A popular algorithm used for \emph{multiple inheritance} is \emph{mixin linearization} \cite{Bracha-Mixin-1990}. Applying this algorithm flattens and unifies the inheritance tree which results in a list that is used to determine the order of inheritance and \lstinline{super()}-calls.

\caption{Visibility support for delegation}
\label{visibilityTable}
\end{wraptable}
Interface-delegation does not support all of Javas visibility features. Field-access cannot be delegated. Therefore public field access is only possible on the child and not on any of the parents. The biggest problem is protected access because it is inherited with class extension. Private visibility is not meant to be inherited at all so this is not a problem for delegation. See table \ref{visibilityTable} for a quick overview.

\section{Our Solution}

\label{suggestedEPSolution}

Our Solution features: a class that contains the \emph{object algebra interface}, the result class interface (\emph{aggregation interface}) and an implementation of the \emph{object algebra}. Surrounding code uses the \emph{object algebra interface} to factorize members of this family that implement the \emph{aggregation interface}. The implementation of the factorization is the \emph{object algebra}, which can be exchanged.

Note that code-examples in this chapter are part of a valid solution to the Expression Problem developed by us. The names of the interfaces and classes are chosen to fit the aimed solution (see figure \ref{combinedClass}.

\subsection{Aggregation Interface}

We use \emph{object algebras} as a factory for classes with a collection of operations (\emph{aggregation classes}). This solution returns an aggregated interface with all operations that are needed, which is different from that proposed by Oliveira et. al. where the object algebras return a different result interface for every operation. This makes it possible for methods of the implementing classes to depend on each other and share state variables (see figure \ref{aggregationInterfaces}).

The \emph{aggregation interface} defines all of the operations that the \emph{aggregation class} has, which is the same way that it is handled in general Java context. The surrounding code addresses just the \emph{aggregation interface} and there is no modification needed.

    }
\end{lstlisting}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Object Algebra Interface}

\label{abstractParameter}

In order to generate objects based on the aggregation interface we need an object algebra that factorizes them. This algebra needs a factory method for every type. Types are identified by their algebraic signature \cite{Oliv-Extensibility-2012}. This means that every type has unique name and parameter types. Parameters can either be abstract or concrete. Abstract parameters differ from concrete parameters in that they refer to the most specific interface in an extension hierarchy, which means the interface of the implementing object algebra. This is similar to the \emph{ThisType} extension proposed by Foster in \emph{Rupiah} \cite{Foster-Rupiah-2001}. The abstract parameter is referenced by a dynamic type parameter "A"\footnote{"A" is a convention. This only means it is dynamic mapped by the object algebra that implements the interface}. The return class of the factory methods also has the abstract type "A" as it represents the \emph{aggregation interface} (see figure \ref{algebraInterfaces}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
    public interface Types <A> {
      public A lit(Integer x);
    }
    public interface Types2 <A> extends Types <A> {
      public A add(A e1,A e2);
    }
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Interfaces for algebras with the signature of the types}
\label{algebraInterfaces}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Object Algebra}

The main part of the object algebra is to instantiate the dependencies like super-classes of a called type and then instantiate the called type and make the dependencies available. The concrete implementations of the \emph{aggregation interface} are done using anonymous classes\footnote{Anonymous classes are desugared by the Java preprocessor into real classes with all available \emph{final} variables as private fields so they can be accessed within the anonymous class} within the object algebra methods (see figure \ref{algebraImplementation}). This technique is employed to keep users from specifying concrete classes instead of interface in their code; because referencing super-types does not work with \emph{delegation} which is used use for \emph{multiple inheritance}.

In figure \ref{algebraImplementation} in the Lit.print()-implementation we can either use \_instance2 or \_instance3 to delegate to. Coincidentally, both refer to the same operation in our example, but this can differ in another environment. To find the best ancestor for delegation one should use a linearization like that suggested by Bracha \cite{Bracha-Mixin-1990} for Mixins.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
public class Algebra4 implements Types <Methods2> {
  public Methods2 add(final Methods e1,
                      final Methods e2){
    final Methods _instance =new Algebra3().add(e1,e2);
    return new Methods2() {
             public Integer count() {
                 return e1.count() + 1 + e2.count();
             }
             public String print() {
                 return _instance.print();
             }
         };
  }
  public Methods lit(Integer x) { 
    final Methods2 _instance2 = new Algebra2().lit(x);
    final Methods _instance3 = new Algebra3().lit(x);
    return new Methods2() {
             public Integer count() { 
                 return _instance2.count();
             }
             public String print() { 
                 return _instance3.print();
             }
         };
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The resulting Algebra-class for the third extension (Algebra2 and Algebra3 likewise)}
\label{algebraImplementation}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Dynamic Dispatch}
\label{dynamicDispatch}

As Tempero et. al. point out, there are some limits to multiple inheritance with delegation \cite{Tempero-Multiple-2000}. We developed a workaround\footnote{The workaround is available online \cite{Peuscher-GitHub-EP-2014}} for the limit of \emph{dynamic dispatch} for \emph{dependent methods} (called \emph{self-calls} by Tempero et. al.). It has some downsides (see section \ref{discussionDynamicDispatch}) but works as expected.

The main idea of dynamic dispatch with delegation is to have a field of the original object in every delegation super-object. Therefore, the original-object has to be injected into all classes.

To achieve this we have to alter the aggregation interface. We add a setter with a generic type that extends from the according \lstinline{Methods} (because we do not know the last extension at this point). The visible methods of this generic type are the same as the ones from the \lstinline{Methods} interface itself (see figure \ref{dynamicDispatchMethods}).

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java]
public interface Methods {
  public String print();
^\Hiline^  public <B extends Methods> void setSelfRef(B selfRef);
}
public interface Methods2 extends Methods {
  public Integer count();
^\Hiline^  public <B extends Methods2> void setSelfRef(B selfRef);
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Dynamic dispatch: Adding a setter for the original object with a dynamic type \emph{B}. Needs to be done for every \lstinline{Methods} interface}
\label{dynamicDispatchMethods}
\end{figure}

With every new Methods interface a new setter has to be introduced and implemented. When called, Java calls the method with the best matching\footnote{\emph{best matching} means if an interfaces extends another interface and both could match on a method, the method with the extending class referenced is called} interface. The setter of every super interface therefore, has to be implemented even though it will not be called. The correct setter injects the original object into every super object, which inject the original object into their super objects and so on. Within the factory method the factorized object is injected into its super objects, which they then transfer into their super objects and thus overwrite the existing reference. This means that the last object to be factorized overwrites all references in every super object.

Dependent methods that call other methods of the calls only have to do their calls on the selfRef-object.

\subsection{Usage}
\label{combiningTheParts}
To just enumerate the interfaces and algebras would be very confusing. To overcome this we suggest a form that defines the interfaces and classes into a combined class (see figure \ref{combinedClass}).

To address the interface of expressions of this family, one uses \lstinline{[Familyname].Methods}. The object algebra is available with a singleton pattern. This is used not only for convenience, but also because the family class is not stateful and to minimize memory usage. A user calls the singleton and gets the algebra of type \lstinline{[Familyname].Types<[Familyname].Methods>} that he uses for initialization of the expression.

\subsubsection*{Extending Families}
\label{extendingFamilies}

To extend this family the developer creates a new outer class where the \lstinline{Methods}- and \lstinline{Types<A>}-interface\footnote{In terms of consistency the interfaces should be extended even when empty}, as well as the algebra and the singleton (that returns the algebra), are located. The \lstinline{Methods}- and \lstinline{Types<A>}-interface implement all the \lstinline{Methods}- and \lstinline{Types<A>}-interfaces of the families that are to be combined. The algebra implements the \lstinline{Types<Methods>}-interface. New types are added in the \lstinline{Types<A>}-interface (and accordingly their implementation in the algebra). The \lstinline{Methods}-interface has the setSelfRef-method (see figure \ref{dynamicDispatchMethods}) and the newly added methods. The algebra has to implement every type and in every type every method of the \lstinline{Methods}- and \lstinline{Types<A>}-interface and either implement its own methods or delegate every method call (see figure \ref{dynamicDispatchAlgebra}). All types have to be implemented, their creation is not delegated. The references have to be modified from the previous examples to meet this structure (e.g. instead of Methods2: [Familyname].Methods, instead of new Algebra2(): [Familyname].algebra(), etc.).

\begin{figure}[H]

\subsection{Solution to the Problem}

Below is a list of checks used to determine if our solution is a valid solution to the Expression Problem, as proposed by Wadler and Odersky \cite{Wadler-Expression-1998, Odersky-Expression-2005}:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Extensibility in both dimensions}: The solution can be extended by either new operations or new data variants (types). This is shown in section \ref{extendingFamilies} "Extending Families".
  \item \emph{Strong static type safety}: Static type safety is provided as there are neither explicit casts nor explicit type checks needed.
  \item \emph{No modification or duplication}: Although there is much boilerplate code that comes with every extension the code in previous packages is not being touched when extended.
  \item \emph{Separate compilation}: We do not need code to be recompiled on extension because every package refers only to its own or its super interfaces and classes.
  \item \emph{Independent extensibility}: With delegation instead of inheritance the extensions can be combined independently without touching existing code.
\end{itemize}

Our solution complies with all of the requirements above. Therefore, it considered it a valid solution.

\section{Related work}

There are plenty of solutions to the Expression Problem in literature. These can be divided into two groups: solutions that rely on syntax extensions and solutions that do not rely on syntax extensions. In this section we compare our work on the Expression Problem with solutions that do not rely on syntax extensions.

\subsection*{The Expression Problem Revisited}

\emph{The Expression Problem Revisited} is a paper about a solution to the EP by Torgersen published in 2004 \cite{Torgersen-Expression-2004}.
Torgersen's definition of a valid solution is less restrictive. It allows for code to be recompiled but not changed and allows casting under the condition that every combination has to be handled. The restrictions proposed by Wadler \cite{Wadler-Expression-1998} do not allow solutions to depend on recompilation and they force solutions to use static type safety. So, although the restrictions for recompiling code are looser, everyone of Torgersen's solutions meet the strict requirements of Wadler for recompiling code and therefore, we consider the requirements met. We only compare the first solution because it has a very similar structure to ours. The comparison to the other three solutions has been presented by Torgersen in his paper.

Torgersen's first approach is (as is ours) \emph{data-centered}, which means the structure, from where the extensions are derived, are types. It uses type parameters to make sure that the constructors are called with the correct (sub-)type. Extension of classes is similar to generic sub-typing except in the case of the type parameter, which has to be transferred. To eliminate F-Bounds another sub-type without type parameters is needed. This is done by using an abstract factory to generate types of the correct family.

The difference between Torgersen's and our approach is mostly the inheritance. Our approach features independent extension, which we made possible by using delegation. The result is that we do not need type parameters in our \lstinline{Methods}-interface. Also we do not need the F-Bounds free subtype as our types are already F-Bound free. Instantiation with abstract factories (object algebras) is generally handled in the same way.

Torgersen's solution is similar to ours but with simple inheritance instead of multiple inheritance.
Unlike Torgersens, our solution uses delegation for inheritance, which unfortunatly does not support \emph{dynamic binding}. We overcame the \emph{dynamic binding} problem but it comes with some downsides which are explained in section \ref{discussionDynamicDispatch} whereas the solution by Torgersen uses Java inheritance which does not have these problems.

\subsection*{Some Challenging Typing Issues in Object-Oriented Languages: Extended Abstract}

{Some Challenging Typing Issues in Object-Oriented Languages: Extended Abstract} is a paper about an extended Java language that solves the EP among other things by Bruce published in 2003\cite{Bruce-Typing-2003}.
Bruce's solution depends on a Java language extension named "Rupiah"\cite{Foster-Rupiah-2001}. The extension supports a concept called \emph{ThisType}, which adds a dynamic type to every class. This type is comparable to the dynamic field "this" and describes the type of an instantiated object. With \emph{ThisType}, a super-class is able to reference the type of a derived sub-class, which solves the problem of \emph{abstract types} that object algebras were used to solve. Unfortunately Java does not yet include a feature similar to ThisType.

\section{Discussion}

This chapter discusses the usage of delegation in lieu of regular inheritance. It discusses a view on the advantages and the disadvantages that come with multiple inheritance and delegation.

\subsection{Delegation}
We used delegation to support the requirement of \emph{independent extensibility} \cite{Odersky-Expression-2005, Oliv-Extensibility-2012}. The solution of Oliveira et. al. supports some kind of independent extensibility, but there were some difficulties in its implementation. Also it is not very easily generated because the needed background-knowledge of the implementation needs to be used in the generation process. Also the use of this solution is very inconvenient for the surrounding code. Another point that kept us from using a solution like the one from Oliveira et. al. is that it does not fully support depending methods. We worked out a solution how they could work and found it to be even more difficult to generate than the independent extensibility.

Delegation comes with some overhead in memory usage, instantiation speed and usage speed. This is because for every inheritance there has to be at least another object that is to be kept in memory. This can be a problem in very complex inheritance trees. Also, because operations are delegated through the inheritance tree, the execution of them is slightly slower.

On the other hand, delegation gives us the possibility to extend types independently and support multiple inheritance. Also, with our solution to dynamic dispatch for delegation, many of the problems delegation brings, are erased.

\subsection{Dynamic Dispatch}
\label{discussionDynamicDispatch}

When not used properly \emph{delegation} does not work exactly like inheritance. We tried to adapt the \emph{dynamic dispatch} of inheritance to delegation. It works as one would expect inheritance to work. Therefore intern method calls have to be done on an extra fields instead of the current namespace or with the \lstinline{this}-reference. With this workaround we are able to use \emph{multiple inheritance}-like extension in Java.

Our solution to dynamic dispatch for delegation has some downsides that one should keep in mind when using it.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \emph{Code}: Dynamic Dispatch increases the boilerplate code very much. This depends on the structure and entities. In our example the whole code was increased by about 45\%, but as we want to generate the code anyway this is not that much of a problem.
  \item \emph{Convenience}: The access to the dependent methods have to be executed on a instance field instead of implicitly by calling the namespace-method. Also, when providing self-reference (e.g. when implementing Observer pattern\cite{Gof-Design-1993}) it has to be done with the same field. This might be overcome with desugaring.
  \item \emph{Performance}: In complex extension combinations the instantiation could take more time and more memory. However, as the solution just copies references we believe that this not have too much of an impact on both memory time and speed.
  \item \emph{Visibility}: Our main idea to overcome the missing \emph{dynamic dispatch} is to set the main object into every super class. We cannot use visibility to limit the external access because the algebra would not have access to set it in the first place. Therefore it is also not safe against nullpointer exceptions.
\end{itemize}

Excessive \emph{boilerplate code} and poor \emph{convenience} are two of the most important problems. Our solution sets out to solve these. In the next chapter we present a solution that addresses both of these difficulties by implementing a SugarJ library that generates most of the boilerplate code and modifies the written code so that a user does not have to worry about the special solution.






%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Syntax Extension





\chapter{Syntax Extension For The Solution}

In this chapter we develop a SugarJ library that features a syntax extension for the solution to the \emph{Expression Problem} we developed in the previous chapter. With this work we provide an experience report on working with SugarJ to develop libraries that provide domain specific languages \cite{Erdweg-SugarJ-2011}. The solution should meet the requirements, that users have on languages generally. Therefore we compare the syntax with different applicable \emph{Cognitive Dimensions} \cite{Green-Cognitive-1996}.

The solution to the Expression Problem from the previous chapter is a great fit for this purpose because it is developed with the intend to generate most parts of the code. We develop a syntax that represents the roles of the solution and then develop a Stratego ruleset that provides the rewriting for the solution. All the work is done in the SugarJ environment, making it easy to use the solution actually in an IDE.

SugarJ is a very young framework. Therefore most of the work in literature yet is written by the authors of SugarJ and is about extending, describing possible use cases and working on the framework \cite{Fehrenbach-Retrofitting-2011, Erdweg-Composition-2012, Erdweg-Editor-2011, Erdweg-SugarHaskell-2012, Erdweg-Questionnaire-2013}. We want to provide a view on a special use case from an unaffiliated user from learning the concepts to implementing a working library.


\section{Background}

To develop this syntax extension we use SugarJ a framework to extend syntax in Java. SugarJ itself relies on \emph{Syntax Defintion Formalism} and \emph{Stratego/Xt}. To describe the types we use \emph{algebraic signatures}. We compare our syntax in \emph{Cognitive Dimensions} to provide an appropriate quality.

This section introduces the used technologies.

\subsection{SugarJ}

SugarJ is a framework which allows seamless integration of syntactic sugar (for Java) into an IDE such as Eclipse \cite{Erdweg-SugarJ-2011}. It uses the \emph{Spoofax framework}, which makes new syntax definitions just in time available in the editor. SugarJ uses syntax definition formalism (SDF) to provide new non-terminals and keywords for language detection \cite{Heering-SDF-1989}. It then uses Stratego/XT rules and strategies to manipulate the generated ATerm tree and afterwards export the valid code in Java \cite{Kats-Spoofax-2010, Brand-ATerms-2000}.

SugarJ uses SDF to define syntax (see example in figure \ref{exampleSDFJavaClassDecHead}). There is already a SDF of Java language available in the SugarJ repository where one can lookup design and structure of the language and find information about how to derive ones own language extensions \cite{Heering-SDF-1989, Brand-SDF-2007, Java-SDF-2014}. With this definition, an IDE that supports the Spoofax framework is able to parse, verify and syntax highlight code that is written in this new syntax.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,breaklines=false]
( Anno | ClassMod )* "class" Id TypeParams? Super? 
    Interfaces? -> ClassDecHead {cons("ClassDecHead")}}.
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Example of the Java class head with \emph{SDF} \cite{Java-SDF-2014}}
\label{exampleSDFJavaClassDecHead}
\end{figure}

In the second step, SugarJ uses Stratego/XT to rewrite parts of the ATerm (tree representation of a whole syntax representation in SDF) of a language with various rules to remove every non-terminal that might be added by the previous SDF \cite{Stratego-Manual, Kats-Spoofax-2010, Brand-ATerms-2000, Visser-Stratego-2003}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,breaklines=false,morekeywords={field1,field2,field3,annot,typeParams,result,methodName,params,throws,body,rest},keywordstyle=\bfseries\color{OliveGreen}]
function-search-methods-bodyparts: [] -> []
function-search-methods-bodyparts:
  [FieldDec(field1,field2,field3) | rest]
    -> <function-search-methods-bodyparts> rest
function-search-methods-bodyparts:
  [MethodDec(MethodDecHead(annot,typeParams,result,
      Id(methodName),params,throws),body) | rest]
    -> <concat>[[
		   AbstractMethodDec(annot,typeParams,result,
		     Id(methodName),params,throws)
		          ],
		          <function-search-methods-bodyparts> rest]
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{Example of a \emph{Stratego/XT} rule that searches and replaces methods by according abstract methods and removes fields to generate the contents of an interface from a class}
\label{exampleStrategoClassInterfaceTranslation}
\end{figure}


SugarJ uses these two technologies, in combination with the Spoofax framework, to define new domain languages (SDF), that an IDE can use to utilize (Spoofax), and afterwards transform into valid Java code\footnote{There are also frameworks like SugarJ for \emph{Haskell} (SugarHaskell) and \emph{Prolog} (SugarProlog)} (Stratego). This process is called \emph{Desugaring}, because syntactic sugar, matched with a language extension via SDF is transformed from generic code into another language that assigns the idea of the domain language to it.


\subsection{Algebraic Signature}

\label{albegraicSignature}

An \emph{algebraic signature} is the structure of a type and contains its return type, its parameters and its name {Oliv-Extensibility-2012}. Parameters can either be abstract of concrete. Abstract parameters represent the current interface that factorizes the main object. In the example described in section \ref{example} the signature of "Lit" is \lstinline{Lit: Integer -> Methods} and the signature of "Add" is \lstinline{Add: Methods x Methods -> Methods}. The algebraic signature of a type is the same among family inheritances, although the \lstinline{Methods}-type is abstract so that it is adapted to the interface of the according family.

\subsection{Cognitive Dimensions}
\label{backgroundCognitiveDimensions}

To get a neat integration and a wide usage of a language extension one needs to check the integration features with the existing language.

This is done using \emph{cognitive dimensions}, which describe a set of features and rules that are used to check the performance of the a language against standard metrics \cite{Green-Cognitive-1996}. \emph{Cognitive dimensions} are also used when designing new syntax to ensure the new code will meet the quality of the code.

\subsubsection*{The \emph{Consistency} Metric}

The consistency of a language can be determined by how easy it is to adapt all features of a language while being familiar with only some features of the language. It is very important that consistency is considered when implementing syntax extensions that extend a complete language with syntactic sugar. After all, the main goal of syntax extensions is to simplify features that would otherwise be difficult to implement.


\subsubsection*{The \emph{Viscosity} Metric}

The viscosity of a language describes the effort that is required to perform a single change. As long as lowering the effort does not conflict with the readability of the code, then the lower the effort - the better this condition is met.


\subsubsection*{The \emph{Progressive Evaluation} Metric}

Progressive evaluation describes if a developer gets feedback from a partially-complete program.


\section{SugarJ Library}

In this chapter we define a new syntax that is stripped down to the essential parameters that are needed for a solution of the Expression Problem. Afterwards we develop a SugarJ library which transforms the new syntax to our solution of the Expression Problem in chapter \ref{theProblem}.

Notice that code-examples in this chapter use the new syntax extension.

\subsection{Family Syntax}

A \emph{Family} represents an expression or an extension to an existing expression (distinguished by wether the family has an "extend"-clause or not). It is a structure to couple the entities to be part of the expression. Expression elements have the same interface. In each family, every class implements the family interface. Every public operation that exists in one of the elements of the family has to be in every other of them. Families can extend each other independently. Every derived family inherits the public methods of the super families and the elements have to implement the missing methods. Methods in families can be overwritten.

A family of the third extension of our example in section \ref{example}, where IntSub and IntCount are the first and second extending families would only implement the missing method "count" on the entity "Add" (See figure \ref{thirdExtensionFamily}). The classes and methods that are not implemented are delegated to their extended family instances. The family \lstinline{IntAddCount} in figure \ref{thirdExtensionFamily} includes every type of the extended families \lstinline{IntAdd} and \lstinline{IntCount}. If these families are implemented like the example in section \ref{example}, \lstinline{IntAdd} would have the types \lstinline{Lit} and \lstinline{Add} and the operation \lstinline{print()} whereas \lstinline{IntCount} would have the type \lstinline{Lit} and the operations \lstinline{print()} and \lstinline{count()}. The new family \lstinline{IntAddCount} would then have the types \lstinline{Lit} and \lstinline{Add} and the operations \lstinline{print()} and \lstinline{count()}. When more than one extension implement the same operation for the same type the call for this method is delegated to the \emph{last} extension in the list of extending families.

\label{familyDependentType}
To reference to an \emph{abstract parameter} (see section \ref{abstractParameter}) we use the family name as type. This does not change the \emph{algebraic signature} (see section \ref{albegraicSignature}) of a given type since the definition of algebraic signature says that \emph{abstract parameters} do not change among inheritance.

Parameters of the algebraic signature are available in the scope of every method in the family class of it. They are desugared to final private fields in the class, so they can be used just like any other final field (see figure \ref{thirdExtensionFamily}).

\begin{figure}[h]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=exprExt]
family IntAddCount extends IntAdd,IntCount {
  family class Add (IntAddCount e1,IntAddCount e2) {
    public Integer count () {
      return new Integer(e1.count() + 1 + e2.count());
    }
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{The third extension of the example (see section \ref{example}) with families. \lstinline{e1} and \lstinline{e2} are available as final fields in the methods of the family class.}
\label{thirdExtensionFamily}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Defining the Syntax Extension}
We define the syntax extension in SDF. The SDF-matching generates an ATerm that represents the whole structure of the code. It uses constructors that have the parameters of the variable parts in the entity. The other structure type are lists. Based on the definition in figure \ref{exampleSDFJavaClassDecHead} - a constructor of \lstinline{ClassDecHead} would for example be \lstinline[breaklines=false,morekeywords={field1,field2,field3,annot,typeParams,result,methodName,params,throws,body,rest},keywordstyle=\bfseries\color{OliveGreen}]{ClassDecHead([Public()],"Lit",None(),None(),None())}. A list will be indicated by brackets seen in this example at the visilibity: "[Public()]".

We need an entry point for the existing non-terminals (constructors are non-terminals) in Java language. We chose the \emph{JavaTypeDec} as it is the top level\footnote{On top of that are only imports and namespaces which cannot be matched by SugarJ, because they are used to define which SugarJ-library will be used.} of declaration in Java, where every class, interface, etc. is declared. We define a new keyword "family" and bring it into context with our own structure. To not reinvent the wheel, we referred to the generic Java non-terminals as often as possible (e.g. JavaClassBody, we do not have to redefine what a class-body contains of). After that, the new syntax could be matched. In figure \ref{sdfFamilies} the whole SDF for our syntax extension can be seen.

To define the syntax, we first have to define the keywords, which is only the "family" in our case. The lexical restrictions define which characters can be (or not be) next to the keyword to let it still count as keyword. Afterwards we can use the keyword in the syntax declaration. The structure of the family syntax declaration orientates on the syntax declaration of Java classes. The entry point can be seen in line 7: JavaTypeDec is the top level declaration type. That means families are expected on the top level of a file right beneath the imports where one would generally write class and interface declarations. The exit point is in line 21 and 22 where the JavaClassBody is referenced. That means a generic JavaClassBody-element (like fields and methods) can be placed inside a \emph{family class}.

\subsection{Rewriting the Syntax Extension to Java-Code}
The rewriting rules have to be defined strict\footnote{On the top level however you can generate either a list or a top level element, which is important if you want to generate more than just one top level element. But we found this as the only exception.}. Unnecessary Brackets are not automatically ignored. We found the use of the embedded syntax for Java code to be to restrictive. We need to generate new structures based on derived code, so we choose to use only ATerm matching and rewriting. The Stratego manual \cite{Stratego-Manual} is very helpful especially for the documentation of built-in strategies.

For example of a \emph{Stratego} rule, see figure \ref{exampleStrategoClassInterfaceTranslation}. The code of our \emph{Stratego} rules are about 1200 lines. The entry point of the rewriting is the \lstinline{desugar-family} strategy, that generates the outer Java class of our solution.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,breaklines=false,morekeywords={familyname,super,familyClasses},keywordstyle=\bfseries\color{OliveGreen}]
  desugar-family:
    FamilyDec(
      FamilyDecHead(FamilyClassId(familyname), super)
    , FamilyBody(familyClasses)

        ClassDec(
          ClassDecHead([Public()], Id(familyname)
          , None(), None(), None())
        , ClassBody([
            <desugar-family-type-interface> (
              familyname,super,familyClasses)
          , <desugar-family-function-interface> (
              familyname,super,familyClasses)
          , <desugar-family-class> (
              familyname,super,familyClasses)
          , FieldDec(
              [Protected(), Static()]
            , ClassOrInterfaceType(
                TypeName(Id("Algebra")), None())
            , [VarDec(Id("_algebra"))])
          , <desugar-family-algebra> (familyname)
          ])
	     )]
      , <desugar-family-sugar>
          (familyname
            , <family-super-list>super,familyClasses)
      ]
\end{lstlisting}
\caption{First rule that is applied and desugars a \emph{family} declaration. It generates the outer class and delegates the implementation of the different parts (interfaces, classes) to other rules. The last rule (desugar-family-sugar) generates a new SugarJ library with variable parts.}
\label{exampleStrategoClassInterfaceTranslation}
\end{figure}

We cannot cover all of the rules in this thesis and most of them look very equal, but based on the main rule (\emph{desugar-family} - see figure \ref{exampleStrategoClassInterfaceTranslation}) we give a closer look about some special cases. The first part before the arrow (->) is the matching of the ATerm. There are three variables in which the sub-terms are saved: \bfseries familyname\mdseries, \bfseries super \mdseries and \bfseries familyClasses \mdseries. \bfseries familyname \mdseries is a string with the name of the family, \bfseries super \mdseries is an ATerm that either is \lstinline{None()} or \lstinline{FamilySuper(...)} and \bfseries familyClasses \mdseries is either \lstinline{[ ]} (empty list) or \lstinline{[FamilyClassDec(...),...]} . In the second part the \lstinline{<...>}-calls are explicit calls to rules with the next ATerm as parameter.

\subsubsection{\textless desugar-family-function-interface\textgreater, \textless desugar-family-type-interface\textgreater, \textless desugar-family-algebra\textgreater{} and FieldDec(...)}

The right side of the arrow has a very similar structure to the example in figure \ref{combinedClass}. The lines 7-24 of the example are actually used to generate the code in this example. The \lstinline{<desugar-family-type-interface>}-rule generates the object algebra interface (\lstinline{Types<A>} see \ref{algebraInterfaces}) and the \lstinline{<desugar-family-function-interface>}-rule generates the aggregation interface (\lstinline{Methods} see \ref{dynamicDispatchMethods}). Both are very simple because they just generate a fix structure with the according \lstinline{extends}-clauses as the family itself. Only the types and methods in the actual family have to be written, because the rest is inherited. "Overwriting" inherited methods does not make any difference. The \lstinline{<desugar-family-algebra>}-rule has even more static content. It generates the \lstinline{Algebra()}-singleton where only the familyname is needed. The \lstinline{FieldDec(...)}-part is part of the singleton and is the field where the single instance is saved. It is extra in this structure because when we would return a list in \lstinline{<desugar-family-algebra>}-rule, the Java pretty printer would fail with an error. It would try to parse a list in the ClassBody list that it does not expect as a list is no ClassBodyDec.

The more difficult parts are in the \lstinline{\textless desugar-family-sugar\textgreater}-rule and the \lstinline{\textless desugar-family-class\textgreater}-rule.

\subsubsection{\textless{}desugar-family-sugar\textgreater}
The \lstinline{<desugar-family-sugar>}-rule is used to export meta data about a special family. The proposed method to use content from other desugarings is to define a SugarJ library within the desugaring process. The SugarJ parser will generate a SugarJ library that any other SugarJ library can include and use the rules in this library. The importing does not even has to be inside the SugarJ code but in a (sugared) domain language file that includes both SugarJ libraries. We use this technique to export the types, methods and all super families so that an extending family knows which types and methods it has to delegate and knows to which super family it has to extend to. The SugarJ/Stratego file that the example in figure \ref{thirdExtensionFamily} generates has 5 rules in it:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \lstinline{typeList ("IntAlgSubCount")}: this rule returns a list of pairs of algebraic signatures of \emph{types} in this structure: (typeName,[parameterName1,parameterName2,...]).
    \item \lstinline{methodList ("IntAlgSubCount")}: this rule returns a list of pairs of \emph{methods} and their parameters in this structure: (methodName,[parameterName1,parameterName2,...]).
    \item \lstinline{typeHead (typeName,[parameterName1,...])}: Returns the type method head for the algebra and the parameters that are needed to delegate the type if it is not overwritten by the extending family.
    \item \lstinline{methodHead (methodName,[parameterName1,...])}: Returns the method head and the parameters that are needed to delegate the method if it is not overwritten by any type of the extending family.
    \item \lstinline{superList ("IntAlgSubCount")}: Returns a list of all super families that this family inherits from. This is needed for all the \lstinline{setSelfRef(...)} methods that have to be implemented (see section \ref{dynamicDispatch}).
\end{itemize}
Because the methodHead-rule and typeHead-rule return complex structures and the effort to generate the rule that would return the structures with constructors and lists would be too big, we serialize the structure into a string and on calling the rule, deserialize it. The rules for this (de-)serialization are built into Stratego and are called "write-to-string" (for serialization) and "read-from-string" (for deserialization).

The SugarJ-libraries are fortunately included implicitly because the families that an extension extends have to be imported explicitly which includes the generated SugarJ libraries.

\subsubsection{\textless{}desugar-family-class>\textgreater}
The \lstinline{<desugar-family-class>}-rule generates the algebra. This includes the delegation which would not work if we would not have the exported metadata from the super families. With this data the generation of types and methods is mostly simple iterating over lists and generating the delegation code where either whole types or only methods of types are not overwritten. The setSelfRef-Methods that are derived by every super family are generated with the metadata that was exported by the super families.

We do not want the user to have to worry about the selfRef-implementation so we need to desugar every implicit method-call without an object and every \lstinline{this}-method-call to be redirected to the selfRef-object. For this operation we need a \emph{strategy}\footnote{A strategy is a rule, that defines how a given rule is applied.} that does not need to be applied to a fix structure but that searches an ATerm for a structure and replace it everywhere. There are some strategies built into Stratego that support this feature. We choose the "innermost" strategy. The call of a rule with this strategy looks like this: \lstinline{<innermost(method-code-replacements)> ATerm}. The according rule to replace every occurrence of an implicit method-call by a call on the selfRef-object is shown in figure \ref{replaceMethodBySelfRef}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\begin{lstlisting}[language=java,breaklines=false,morekeywords={familyname,super,familyClasses},keywordstyle=\bfseries\color{OliveGreen}]

      ,Id(methodName)))

\section{Related Work}

SugarJ is in an early stage of popularity. Therefore there are not many papers that \emph{use} SugarJ but many \emph{about} SugarJ. This section compares our work with SugarJ with the paper we found that was comparable.

\subsection{Embedding a Questionnaire DSL with SugarJ \cite{Erdweg-Questionnaire-2013}}

The paper is from Erdweg, the main founder of SugarJ, so the knowledge of him about the technology is very high. Compared to our situation, where the study of the technology can be seen as part of the work, the code is obvious superior. The semantic structuring among different files is consistent where in our work, everything is in one combined file. He uses features that we either did not know existed or did not understand their use like annotations and editor commands. On the other hand we consciously decided to not use embedded Java syntax. Our rules do not contain much static content. Therefore we decided to used plain aterm rules.

It is not surprising that the work is a sovereign example how work with SugarJ can look. Questionnaire is very great example how powerful SugarJ is.


\section{Discussion}

This section compares our syntax extension to the \emph{Cognitive Dimensions} from section \ref{backgroundCognitiveDimensions}.

\subsection{Cognitive Dimensions}

We take a look at how well our syntax extension does against the cognitive dimension metrics.

\subsubsection*{The \emph{Consistency} Metric}

The \emph{family syntax} meets this requirement, because it consists of classes that have mostly the same syntax and features as every other class a user would write. The context of an interface family has the same symbols as an interface would have. The binding of the classes in the family to the interface name communicates the outer interface to be met by the inner classes.

Because multiple inheritance is not part of Java, a given algorithm to delegate derived calls to the super objects is not forced. The reversed extend-order does not violate this rule.

\subsubsection*{The \emph{Viscosity} Metric}

In the \emph{family} syntax, the effort for a change is very low. Because every method that is added to a class will extend the interface and every type that is defined in the family will implement the interface, it does not have to be updated explicitly. To extend a class, one simply has to define it and does not need to know if: a) it was already derived from a previous family or b) which methods have to be derived.

\subsubsection*{The \emph{Progressive Evaluation} Metric}

Our draft does not support this requirement yet, because of the need for static type checks. But it would be possible in a future implementation to allow methods that have not been implemented in a type to throw an exception. Now the compiler would fail on a missing method.

\section{Limitations}
\label{syntaxExtensionLimitations}

Although the syntax extension alone is only limited by the ideas we have, we provide a solution to desugar this syntax to valid Java code that is based on our solution to the expression problem (see section "Suggested Solution" \ref{suggestedEPSolution}). There are a few limitations that desugaring caused. To some of the limitations we will provide a potential solution that we could not prove, to a few we only had an idea how to start. Reasons for this limitations were mostly these:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lack of time
  \item The problem is too difficult to solve in the scope of this paper
  \item We do not know if a solution exists
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Visibility}

This was already discovered in chapter "The Expression Problem" \ref{expressionProblemVisibility} and has its reason in the delegation instead of inheritance.
The class only knows public methods, private methods and private fields.

\subsection{Multiple Inheritance Linearization}

The inheritance order follows a simple hierarchical order. Calls to derived methods are delegated to the first Family Interface that has the method in reversed order of the "extends" keyword. Although a linearization like with \emph{Mixins} suggested by Bracha \cite{Bracha-Mixin-1990} would have been more straight-forwarded, the implementation of this algorithm would have been too difficult to implement and include it into this work.

\subsection{Inheritance within family members}

Subtyping of family members from other family members or from outside the family is not genuinely supported.

\subsection{Instantiation and addressing of Members from the Inner Code}

Although you can instantiate new members of the same family with using the \_algebra field, the dependencies of a derived family are not met because there is no method to get to the caller family \_algebra-field.
Addressing a specific family type is also not possible.

\subsection{Real Subtyping-Like Delegation}

Delegation as we chose encapsulates every call into a super object without possibility to call operations on inheriting objects. In subtyping one would expect calls to overwritten methods would be referred to the latest overwritten implementation of a method which could be in the subtype.

\subsection{Different Qualified Type Names}

Java supports the use of different qualified type names with the use of the "import"-command. Our syntax extension only works when resulting types are addressed the same in every derived family. This is the case for family types and methods.

\subsection{Constructors are not Supported}

Classical Java constructors are not supported. With algebraic signatures (see "Strip boilerplate Code" \ref{albegraicSignature}) we eliminated the need for most uses of constructors in Java which is to save instantiation-variables in class-fields.

\subsection{Super is not Supported}

With the keyword "super" one is able to access fields an methods in the scope of the next superclass. This is not supported.

\chapter{Desugaring With SugarJ}
\label{sugarJChapter}

\section{Experience with SugarJ}
In this section we describe our subjective view on the development-process with SugarJ.

\subsection{Installation and IDE}
The installation is quite straight-forwarded and through the eclipse software installation dialog very easy. The instructions can be found on the official site of SugarJ \cite{SugarJ-Homepage}. The interpreter has to be aligned in the target project and a suggestion to push the Java environment variables, but that is all, that is needed to do by hand. When opening a .sugj-file you have a few options to start: Import an existing "Sugar", define your own "Sugar" or use syntax that goes through the process as described (SDF matching, Stratego rewriting). The transform menu gives an easy way to generate aterms from existing code to get a feeling for aterm-transformation of existing code in Java as well as existing SugarJ-code.

\section{Difficulties with SugarJ}
During the development the behavior of SugarJ was not always as we expected it to be. In some cases it took time to figure out how to work around the problems and in one case we just had to accept the time it costed.
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Equal Matching} - SugarJ adds an analysis hashes as annotation to every aterm element. That makes two similar options act not like expected and described in the Stratego-Manual\cite{Stratego-Manual}:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The matching of a term that contains the same variable more than once to match equality between these variables will not match. The reasons are the different hash values that are attached to the elements before the rules are applied and that unify every element in the aterm. There are two workarounds to overcome this: either match for two different variables and add a "where"-clause after the rule to compare them (see the next point) or execute the built in strategy "strip-annos" to the term before the matching.
 \item The "eq"-strategy that matches if two elements are the same does also not work with the aterm because of the hash annotations.  So instead of the "eq"-strategy, one should use the "structurally-equal"-strategy (also built-in) that matches without comparing the annotated hash values.
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Debugging} - SugarJ has a console where it prints out when a desugaring goes wrong. There are two different ways that can happen in the stratego-part of the desugaring:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item The result to the transformed aterm cannot be pretty printed. This is a little bit easier to understand, because the term that was tried to be printed out is echoed to the console and can be analyzed, although you have to check with the Java SDF\cite{Java-SDF-2014} where the problem could be. The full aterm is echoed but if one knew, what he changed, he can find it. Executing "strip-annos" before looking into it makes it easier to read the aterm.
 \item The term could not be matched. The console only prints the aterm that could not be matched, but no more debug-information. With the "write-to-string"-strategy one could print the aterm into a valid output like a string in Java to see how a not matching term looks.
\end{enumerate}
\item \emph{Derive new Libraries} - In some cases it is important to extract information from in a syntax extension desugaring to use in future desugaring. In our example, we need to know which methods have to be implemented, which types are in a super-family, etc. To make this work, we have to generate new sugar-part in our desugared syntax, that includes stratego rules with this information. The simplest to translate aterms into the new libraries is with the serialization of read-from-string and write-to-string.

As the imports of the original code is inherit automatically \footnote{In Chapter 6.5 of Erdweg et. al.'s introduction of SugarJ\cite{Erdweg-SugarJ-2011}}, they wrote about the different scoping rules of imports), we did not need to add imports into the new Sugar-library. Erdweg et al announced that they might rethink this and probably change the way it works. In this case our work would need small alignments.
\item \emph{Stability of the Environment} - SugarJ is a research project. As such it is not entirely checked for its stability against every configuration. We had experienced some minor bugs that could be overcome (e.g. by deactivating "build automatically" in Eclipse) and one major bug that hindered our development about half of the time. The IDE froze randomly when text was marked could not be recovered. We had to kill and restart  Eclipse (without saving) whenever this happened. It seems like it happens only in a specific environment since it occurred after a switch of the development system and the answer to the reported bug was that it could not be reconstructed.
\end{itemize}

\section{Families in SugarJ}

This section describes how we use SugarJ to define our syntax extension in chapter \ref{syntaxExtensionEP} and transform it to the solution we presented in \ref{suggestedEPSolution}.


\section{Missing Features in our Solution}
We already mentioned limitations of our solution in the chapter about the syntax extension \ref{syntaxExtensionLimitations}. We try to provide an estimate if it these features will be supported in the future and some unproven ideas that could lead to a solution.


\subsection{Visibility}

We do not think, that the access of public fields will be possible without desugaring the calling code. Although difficult, access to protected fields could be made possible. Therefore one could have a special factory method with a modified class that includes a method that encapsules the call to protected methods. Protected fields would be solved with protected getters and setters. Every access to one of these methods would be desugared to the object of the modified class.

\subsection{Multiple Inheritance Linearization}
\label{solutionMultipleInheritanceLinearization}
Multiple Inheritance Linearization should be possible with an extension of the generated sugar-rules, to save the inheritance sequence and the including types and method of each inheritance. The algorithm to decide the delegation target of a specific method should be implemented into the strategy "find-super-method".

\subsection{Inheritance within family members}

Delegation to super-families could also be applied to types other than the type with the same name. One could also implement multiple inheritance with this kind of specialization. A linearization algorithm has to be defined as extension of families and extension of other types can be combined.

\subsection{Instantiation and addressing of Members from the Inner Code}

For instantiation constructors of algebras could be equipped with the last algebra as an abstract factory. The code that creates new instances would then be desugared to use the abstract factory instead.

\subsection{Real Subtyping-Like Delegation}
\label{solutionRealSubtypingLikeDelegation}
When instantiating the delegation objects, one could use the original object in the constructor. Adding another method, that uses a linearization to delegate to an expected sub-object would then make it possible to call this method upon a call to a method of the interface. This could be achieved by desugaring the code that does the calls.

\subsection{Different Qualified Type Names}

We believe this could be possible, but the effort would be huge because a type-checker like in the Java-compiler would be needed to resolve the imports. SugarJ has to be adapted to make it possible to match on imports. A more simply problem that could be used with a little downside would be to limit the usage to explicit class imports.

\subsection{Constructors are not Supported}

A constructor behaves a little different than other methods. One could find out the differences and emulate then in a defined constructor-method. Then when instantiating the object in the algebra, the constructor could be called with the emulated behavior.

\subsection{Super is not Supported}

The solution to the \lstinline{super()} call and methods on the super-object could be solved similar to the solution of the "Real Subtyping-Like Delegation" (see \ref{solutionRealSubtypingLikeDelegation}) and the "Multiple Inheritance Linearization" (see \ref{solutionMultipleInheritanceLinearization}).

\subsection{Address Abstract Types in Type Parameters}

In the part of the Stratego rules that replaces the family name by the abstract type, a recursively\footnote{recursively because type parameters could also have type parameters where the family could be found} rule should be called which replaces the family names in type parameters.


\chapter{Use Case}

The following real life example is a proof, that in a working environment the presented solution saves much manual writing and decouples functional extensions and type extensions. All of the outlined features are included in this example.
